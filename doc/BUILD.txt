GENERAL
-------

The builds on Mac and Linux are 64-bit and use static libraries for Geant4,
dynamic libraries for all others.
This release does not include a Windows build.

NOTE: Coin3D has been removed, in favor of OGLSQt. The Qt viewer has essentially
all of the features of Coin3D, plus some new ones. In particular you can still
use the mouse to rotate, pan, and zoom the viewer.

The G4beamline build uses CMake, and has these ON/OFF options:
	G4BL_FFTW	use FFTW (for spacecharge command)
				uses FFTW_DIR
	G4BL_GSL	use GSL (for several commands, including coil)
				uses GSL_DIR
	G4BL_GUI	build the GUI programs (g4blgui, g4bldata); uses Qt
				needs Qt 5.X
	G4BL_MPI	enable MPI (default=OFF)
				needs MPI.cmake
	G4BL_ROOT	use Root (for NTuples)
				uses ROOT_DIR (= ROOTSYS)
	G4BL_VISUAL	enable visualization (with OGLSQt) - needs G4BL_GUI
				needs Qt 5.X
They all default to ON except G4BL_MPI.

You must also specify the directory for each of the libraries (except MPI) --
if you set G4BL_MPI=ON you must edit MPI.cmake for the specific MPI 
configuration of the machine on which you are building.
if G4BL_GUI=OFF and G4BL_VISUAL=OFF, you don't need the Qt libraries (e.g. for
a supercomputer); you must download the Geant4 data sets manually (no g4bldata).

The following libraries are used:
	Geant4 - http://geant4.cern.ch
	CLHEP - internal to Geant4
	Qt - http://www.qt.io/download/   (g4blgui and g4bldata only)
	Root - http://root.cern.ch
	Gnu Scientific Library (gsl) - http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
	FFTW - http://www.fftw.org/
The details and versions vary on the different platforms, so see below for
details.

First you need to select a place to build. I use $HOME/G4beamline-VERSION,
which is used below.

Note that Geant4 uses its internal version of CLHEP, expat, and zlib.

Building Libraries:
The basic idea is that each library gets a directory in $HOME that is
NAME-VERSION. In most cases when building from source, I create a
"build" directory under $HOME/NAME-VERSION, build there, and install to
$HOME/NAME-VERSION. If the source already has a "build" directory, I
use "build-tjr".

As G4beamline is hosted on a Mac, it is presumed that a new release will be
built first on Mac OS X. So the CMake files for Darwin construct some "source"
files used by other OSs: Help.html. It also generates
G4beamline-VERSION-source.tgz

The G4beamline source is hosted on tjrob.dhcp.fnal.gov in user "g4bl". This
is a high-end Mac Pro with 8 dual-thread cores, 16 GB ram, 0.5 TB SSD, and 
6 TB Scratch. It has quintuple geographically diverse back-ups, one of which
is in the cloud (Dropbox.com) and is updated after every modification to any
file.

Top-Level directories in $HOME:
    G4beamline-VERSION		build dir
    G4beamline-source		source dir - symbolic link to 
    				~tjrob/Dropbox/G4beamline-source
    G4beamlineDistributions	dir contining distributions (incl old ones)
    Geant4Data			dir containing downloaded Geant4 Datasets
    geant4.VERSION		build dir
    root-VERSION		Download & build dir
    (On my Mac: Qt, fftw, and gsl are installed in /usr/local by HomeBrew.)

G4beamline-source top-level files:
    CMakeLists.txt		the CMake file for the entire project
    MPI.cmake			CMake file for MPI configuration

G4beamline-source top-level directories:
    Resources			general resource files
    bin				scripts: g4bl-setup.sh, g4bl-setup.csh
    doc				documentation
    examples			examples
    finalize			dir used only for installation sequencing
    g4bl			the g4bl executable
    g4bldata			the g4bldata executable
    g4blgui			the g4blgui executable
    g4blmpi			the g4blmpi executable
    g4bltest			the g4bltest executable
    scripts			scripts for building
    share			shared files
    test			tests
    validation			g4bl input files used in validation

Note that G4BLVERSION is defined in the top-level CMakeLists.txt.
Some scripts use grep & sed to obtain it, so don't change the syntax.

Note that after building the libraries, building G4beamline is quite short.


Doxygen
-------
If you are building G4beamline to add new code, you'll find the Doxygen
documentation invaluable:
	install doxygen
	cd G4beamline-3.08-source/doc
	doxygen
	open in your browser: G4beamline-3.08-source/doc/html/index.html


Updating the Documentation
--------------------------

This is on Mac OS X, using MS Word for Mac 2019 and some shell commands in
a Terminal window.

G4beamline-source/doc:
    BUILD.txt			instructions for building G4beamline
    Doxyfile			doxygen control file
    G4beamlinePresentation.pdf	an old presentation on G4beamline
    G4beamlineUsersGuide.pdf	The G4beamline users Guide
    G4beamlineValidation.pdf	The G4beamline Validation document
    History.txt			Inverse-chronological update history
    README.txt			README file (for binary installations)
    footer			the footer for doxygen pages
    mainpage.md			the main page for doxygen pages

The sources for the .pdf-s are in ~tjrob/Documents/G4beamline, printed to PDF
here. The other files are edited in place.

Updating G4beamlineUsersGuide.pdf:
	open G4beamlineUsersGuide.doc in Word for Mac 
	update any text that need updating, including the title page
	Delete the help text in section 5.8 (G4beamline commands by type)
	In a tmp directory do:
		echo 'help' | g4bl - >index.txt
		edit index.txt and delete extraneous lines at top and bottom
	in Word, insert index.txt and delete extraneous test,  using the
		default encoding (uses Courier 10.5 font, which is OK)
	Delete the help text in section 6 (G4beamline commands (alphabetical))
	In a tmp directory do:
		echo 'help *' | g4bl - >help.txt
		edit help.txt and delede extraneous lines at top and bottom
	in Word, insert help.txt using the default encoding
		(uses Courier 10.5 font, which is OK)
	in Word, apply the style "Heading 2" to every command line (so they
		appear in the table of contents).
	update any appendices that need it.
	Print the file to PDF into the doc directory.


Build - Mac OS X (Darwin)
-------------------------

This is on Mac OS X Catalina (10.15.7), native on my Mac Pro.
The build is 64-bit. This uses the bash shell in a Terminal window.
Geant4 is statically linked, the rest are dynamically linked.

HomeBrew is used to install several libraries.

NOTE: OpenMotif and XQuartz don't play nice together. This as a primary reason
to replace Coin3D with the Qt viewer (Coin3D needs OpenMotif).

Qt
	brew install qt5
	export PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt5/bin:$PATH
	# Note brew also installed qt4 and it is still used by other programs.
	# as long as the correct qmake is in your PATH, cmake will find it.

GSL
	brew install gsl
	export GSL_DIR=/usr/local

FFTW
	brew install fftw
	export FFTW_DIR=/usr/local

Root
	Download root_v6.26.06.macos-10.15-x86_64-clang120.tar.gz and
		untar it in $HOME
	mv root root_v6.26.06
	export ROOTSYS=$HOME/root_v6.26.06

Geant4
	Download geant4-v11.0.2.tar.gz and untar it in $HOME
	cd geant4-v11.0.2
	mkdir build; cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/geant4-v11.0.2 -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON ..
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install # ignore warnings
	# now ../bin, ../lib, and ../include contain the library files
	# (static only)
	export GEANT4_DIR=$HOME/geant4-v11.0.2

G4beamline
	# be sure the above environment variables for the libraries are set
	cd
	mkdir G4beamline-3.08
	cd G4beamline-3.08
	cmake ../G4beamline-source
	# CMakeLists.txt forces the install prefix to be $PWD
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install # ignore warnings

Now you should have these products in G4beamline-3.08 (plus a bunch of 
build files and directories):
	G4beamline-3.08-source.tgz
	G4beamline-3.08.app/
	G4beamline-3.08.dmg
You can run G4beamline from the .app right there, or you can mount the .dmg 
and drag the .app into /Applications.
NOTE: if you run g4blgui directly from the bin directory, its menus may be dead 
-- this is a "feature" of the Mac; run it via the app and all is well.

NOTE: If you get lots of errors related to std::enable_if_t and 
std::i_arithmetic_v, you probably have Qt6 installed, and it confuses Qt5.
Move Qt6 to a temporary directory (or delete/uninstall it) and G4beamline
should build.

For MPI: 
  1. use HomeBrew to install open-mpi (brew install open-mpi).
  2. Edit MPI.cmake to handle your system, probably by copying the
     code for tjrob and editing it appropriately.
  3. add "-DG4BL_MPI=YES" to your cmake command line; you may
     want to set "-DG4BL_VISUAL=NO"; on macOS you must keep "-DG4BL_GUI=YES"
     (the default)
  4. do the cmake
  5. cmake --build . --config Release --target install 
  6. Note that no .app or distribution is built for an MPI build
To run it, use g4blmpi in the bin directory of the folder in which you built
G4beamline. For example, to use 15 ranks:
	$HOME/G4beamline-3.08-MPI/bin/g4blmpi 15 input.file [params...]



Build - Linux CentOS 8 Stream
-----------------------------

This is on the VMware virtual machine "CentOS 8 Stream 64-bit Build", on 
tjrob@tjrob.dhcp.fnal.gov. The following shared folders are mounted:
	MAC		Ubuntu
	---		------
	/Users/tjrob	$HOME/tjrobOnMyMac
	/Users/g4bl	$HOME/g4blOnMyMac
Note that Mac symbolic links are not followed, so for G4beamline source
use $HOME/tjrobOnMyMac/Dropbox/G4beamline-source

The build is 64-bit. This uses the bash shell in a Terminal window.
All libraries but Root and Qt are statically linked.

install cmake:
	sudo yum install cmake
	sudo yum install make	# not installed by default, even though g++ is

Now build the libraries and G4beamline.

Qt
	sudo yum install qt5-qtbase-devel.x86_64
	export PATH=/usr/lib64/qt5/bin:$PATH

GSL
	sudo yum install gsl-devel
	export GSL_DIR=/usr

FFTW
	sudo yum install fftw-devel
	export FFTW_DIR=/usr

Root
	#Download root_v6.26.06.Linux-centos8-x86_64-gcc8.5.tar.gz from
	#    https://root.cern.ch and untar it in $HOME
	mv root root_v6.26.06
	export ROOTSYS=$HOME/root_v6.26.06
	sudo yum install openssl-devel

Geant4
	# Download geant4-v11.0.2.tar.gz from https://geant4.cern.ch
		and untar it in $HOME
	mkdir geant4-v11.0.2
	cd geant4-v11.0.2
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/geant4-v11.0.2 -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON 
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install # ignore warnings
	# now ../bin, ../lib64, and ../include contain the library files
	# (static only)
	export GEANT4_DIR=$HOME/geant4-v11.0.2

G4beamline
	cd
	# be sure the above environment variables for the libraries are set
	# $HOME/g4blOnMyMac is a symbolic link to /mnt/hgfs/g4bl/ which is
	# /Users/g4bl on the Mac. Ditto for tjrob.
	mkdir G4beamline-3.08
	cd G4beamline-3.08
	# CMakeLists.txt forces the install prefix to be $PWD (CMAKE_BINARY_DIR)
	cmake ../tjrobOnMyMac/Dropbox/G4beamline-source
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install # ignore warnings

Now you should have these products in G4beamline-3.08 (plus a bunch of 
build files and directories):
	bin, lib, ...
	G4beamline-3.08-CentOS64.tgz
You can run G4beamline from bin right there, or you can un-tar the .tgz
and run from its bin directory.



Build - Linux Ubuntu 22.04
--------------------------

This is on the VMware virtual machine "Ubuntu 64-bit 22.04 Build", on 
tjrob (my Mac Pro). The following shared folders are mounted:
	MAC		Ubuntu
	---		------
	/Users/tjrob	$HOME/tjrobOnMyMac
	/Users/g4bl	$HOME/g4blOnMyMac
Note that Mac symbolic links are not followed, so for G4beamline source
use $HOME/tjrobOnMyMac/Dropbox/G4beamline-source

The build is 64-bit. This uses the bash shell in an XTerm window.

Qt
	# package qt5-default no longer exists
	sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools
	# make sure /usr/bin/qmake is qt5

GSL
	sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
	export GSL_DIR=/usr

FFTW
	sudo apt-get install fftw3-dev
	export FFTW_DIR=/usr

Root
	# Download root_v6.26.06.Linux-ubuntu22-x86_64-gcc11.2.tar.gz
	#     from root.cern.ch
	# untar it in $HOME, verify that it runs
	mv root root_v6.26.06
	export ROOTSYS=$HOME/root_v6.26.06
	# now root_v6.26.06/bin, lib, and include contain the library files
	# (dynamic only)

Geant4
	# Download geant4-v11.0.2.tar.gz from geant4.cern.ch
	# untar it in $HOME
	# (no TJR edits needed)
	cd geant4-v11.0.2
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/geant4.v11.0.2 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON -DGEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_EXPAT=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGEANT4_USE_RAYTRACER_X11=ON -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON  ..
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install # ignore warnings
	export GEANT4_DIR=$HOME/geant4-v11.0.2
	# now ../bin, ../lib, and ../include contain the library files
	# (static only)

G4beamline
	# be sure the above environment variables for the libraries are set
	mkdir G4beamline-3.08
	cd G4beamline-3.08
	cmake ../tjrobOnMyMac/Dropbox/G4beamline-source
	# CMakeLists.txt forces the install prefix to be $PWD (CMAKE_BINARY_DIR)
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install # ignore warnings

Now you should have these products in G4beamline-3.08 (plus a bunch of 
build files and directories):
	bin, lib, ...
	G4beamline-3.08-Ubuntu64.tgz
You can run G4beamline from bin right there, or you can un-tar the .tgz
and run from its bin directory.


Build - Windows 10 - 64 bit
---------------------------

This is on the VMware Virtual machine "Windows 10 x64 Build".
Be sure to do Windows Update repeatedly until no more.

This is a 64-bit build.

Download and install Visual Studio 2019 Community edition, including command-
line tools. 

Keep setup.bat up-to-date and run it EVERY TIME. It includes the Visual Studio
command-line tools, and the Qt command-line tools. It also sets the environment
variable for Geant4, FFTW, GSL, and Root.

Download and install cmake 3.21.2 (uninstall any previous version first).
Have it put itself into the system path for all users.

Qt
	#Download Qt 5.12.11 offline installer (online install takes forever)
	#/official_releases/qt/5.12/5.12.11/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.12.11.exe
	#Install Qt 5.12.11 for MS VC 2017 64-bit (2019 would be better)
	#setup.bat: @call C:\Qt\Qt5.12.11\5.12.11\msvc2017_64\bin\qtenv2.bat

Geant4
	#download geant4-v11.0.3 source, unpack into %HOMEPATH%
	# In the above cmd window after runing setup.bat:
	cd %HOMEPATH%
	cd geant4-v11.0.3
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="%HOMEPATH%\geant4-v11.0.3" \
		-DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_WIN32=ON \
		-DGEANT4_BUILD_MSVC_MP=ON ..
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install
	#(Took 44 minutes on a 4-core VM)
	#setup.bat: set GEANT4_DIR=C:\Users\tjrob\geant4-v11.0.3

Root
	# download root_v6.26.06.win64.vc17.exe from https://root.cern.ch
	# run it to install Root into C:/root_v6.26.06
	#setuplbat: set ROOTSYS=C:/root_v6.26.06
	# NOTE: use '/', not '\' (\r gets interpreted as <CR> in some places)
	### root_v6.26.06 comes close to working, but does not actually work
	### in G4beamline.

fftw
	#Download https://fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw-3.3.5-dll64.zip and extract 
	#all files into %HOMEPATH% (creates fftw-3.3.5-dll64)
	#Read its README and create subdirectories bin, lib, include; 
	#move fftw3.h into include
	#move *.def into lib
	#move *.dll into bin
	#cd lib and run the 'lib' tool 3 times (see README)
	#setup.bat: set FFTW_DIR=C:\Users\tjrob\fftw-3.3.5-dll64

gsl
	#(32-bit GSL pacakages are availble, but not 64-bit, and the gnu 
	# build scripts are UNIX only; so use vcpkg)
	#install git, bootstrap and install vcpkg (see https://solarianprogrammer.com/2020/01/26/getting-started-gsl-gnu-scientific-library-windows-macos-linux/ )
	#cd C:/DEV/vcpkg
	#.\vcpkg install gsl gsl:x64-windows
	#setup.bat: set GSL_DIR=C:\DEV\vcpkg\packages\gsl_x64-windows

G4beamline:
        cd %HOMEPATH%
        #Make sure setup.bat is up to date and has been run.
        mkdir G4beamline-3.08
        cd G4beamline-3.08
        cmake -DG4BL_ROOT=NO Z:\tjrob\Dropbox\G4beamline-source
        cmake --build . --config Release --target install
	# merge Modules do not work in Windows 11. These files are for VC++ 2019
	copy "..\VC Runtime DLLs\*" bin
	# Now you must use AdvancedInstaller to create the .msi package

Here is setup.bat:

Build - Windows -- OLD 32-bit OLD OLD OLD
---------------

NEW VERSION for Geant4 10.07.p02 - uses cmd window (not Visual Studio GUI).

This is on the VMware Virtual machine "Windows 10 x64 Build".
Be sure to do Windows Update.

Download and install Visual Studio 2017 Community edition, including command-
line tools.

Qt: download Qt 5.12.0 for both 32-bit MSVC2017 and 64-bit. We'll use 32-bit
(for Root).  Installed in C:\Qt\5.12.0
*** Update hard-coded path for QT_BIN_DIR in G4beamline-source/CMakeLists.txt.

In start menu, use "Visual Studio/x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017",
and then:
	call C:\Qt\5.12.0\msvc2017\bin\qtenv2.bat
-- that sets up the 32-bit MS VC++ tools, with 32-bit Qt. Do NOT use any 
64-bit tools or libs.

Better: use "Visual Studio/x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017",
and then:
	call setup.bat
-- that sets up Qt and also sets the environment variables for the libraries.

Already Installed:
	CMake 3.8.0 
	Qt 5.12.0; its qmake is in PATH
	$HOME/fftw-3.3.5-32
	$HOME/gsl-2.3-32
	$HOME/root_v6.15.06.win32.vc15
	C:/Program Files (x06)/GnuWin32/bin/bsdtar

Geant4:
	#download geant4_10_05 source, unpack into geant4_10_05-source
	# In the above cmd window:
	cd %HOMEPATH%
	mkdir geant4_10_05
	cd geant4_10_05
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="%HOMEPATH%\geant4_10_05" \
	    -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_WIN32=ON \
	    -DGEANT4_BUILD_MUONIC_ATOMS_IN_USE=ON -DGEANT4_BUILD_MSVC_MP=ON \
	    "%HOMEPATH%\geant4_10_05-source"
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install
	--- took 24 minutes on a 4-CPU virtual machine.

G4beamline:
	cd %HOMEPATH%
	Make sure these are set (e.g. by setup.bat):
		set GEANT4_DIR=/Users/tjrob/geant4_10_05
		set FFTW_DIR=/Users/tjrob/fftw-3.3.5-32
		set GSL_DIR=/Users/tjrob/gsl-2.3-32
		set ROOTSYS=/Users/tjrob/root_v6.15.06.win32.vc15
	mkdir G4beamline-3.06
	cd G4beamline-3.06
	cmake Z:\g4bl\G4beamline-source
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install
	### Now you must use the Advanced Installer to create the .MSI installer


Build - cori.nersc.gov
------------------------

NOTE: I gave up on trying to use Root on Cori. With a later version
of Root it might be possible, as there is now a flag to omit X-Windows (which
